# OffensivePipeline
![](img/2021-02-18-20-54-21.png)

**OffensivePipeline** allows to download, compile (without Visual Studio) and obfuscate C# tools for Red Team exercises.

OffensivePipeline downloads the tool from the git repository, then compiles it with *msbuild* and finally obfuscates it with [ConfuserEx](https://github.com/mkaring/ConfuserEx/tree/v1.4.1).


## Examples
- List all tools:
```
OffensivePipeline.exe list
```
- Build all tools:
```
OffensivePipeline.exe all
```
- Build a tool
```
OffensivePipeline.exe t toolName
```

## Add new tools
The scripts for downloading the tools are in the **Tools** folder in **yml** format. New tools can be added by creating new *yml* files with the following format:
- *Rubeus.yml* file:
```yml
